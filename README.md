# Money Tracker App

<img src="/app/assets/images/logo.png" width="250">

This project is about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.

## Demo

[MoneyTrackerApp](https://money-tracker-rails-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- Ruby on Rails.
- Linters for RoR.
- Gitflow.

## Getting Started

- In this project, you will use migration files to build your schema.
- Set up models. To start with, we have tables for Users, Categories, Movements, and a join table with the relationship between Categories and Movements call Calsification, which means we need a model for each one. You've already set the foreign key in the table schema but be sure to write it here too!
- In this project, you will add validations to your models and create specs for them.
- Also, you will implement heroku commands to deploy your app.

## Instalation

```
